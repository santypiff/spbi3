## Authentic News Sources

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Be wary, as there is a sustained propaganda war being waged on all of social
  media. Many accounts with a large following publish news stories without
  proper references, solely for the purpose of generating views and earning
  payouts. In my humble opinion, the following are the only official sources of
  information. The reader is encouraged to do their own research (DYOR).

1. Search for charities mentioned on Twitter or via a web search actively assisting those affected.
2. Write to your politician expressing your concern.
3. Donate for the purchase of [eSims](https://twitter.com/SpeakUp_00/status/1735842857632584191). Follow [activists](https://twitter.com/Mirna_elhelbawi) for updates on this.
4. Increase awareness with only verifiable facts.
5. Refrain from reactionary posting.
6. Be extremely critical of accounts posting information without references.
7. Send prayers.
8. Don't argue with Islamophobic, Zionist, or anti-Palestinian trolls online. They are all fake accounts being operated by troll farms in India.
