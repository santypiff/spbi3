  Be wary, as there is a sustained propaganda war being waged on all of social

1. Search for charities mentioned on Twitter or via a web search actively assisting those affected.
2. Write to your politician expressing your concern.
3. Donate for the purchase of [eSims](https://twitter.com/SpeakUp_00/status/1735842857632584191). Follow [activists](https://twitter.com/Mirna_elhelbawi) for updates on this.
4. Increase awareness with only verifiable facts.
5. Refrain from reactionary posting.
6. Be extremely critical of accounts posting information without references.
7. Send prayers.
8. Don't argue with Islamophobic, Zionist, or anti-Palestinian trolls online. They are all fake accounts being operated by troll farms in India.
