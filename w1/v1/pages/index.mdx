## Authentic News Sources

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Be wary there is a sustained propganda war being waged on all of social media,
  With many accounts with a lerge following publishing news stories with no
  references and are just views farming for payouts. The following are the only
  official sources of information IMHO. The reader is encoraged to DYOR.
